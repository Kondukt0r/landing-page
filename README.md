# landing-page

This project is supposed to summarize the Web Dev skills I have aquired so far.
Since I'm going to be making a "landing page", I will try my best to add some aviation references (cheers to Cpt. Martin).

Will come back here during or after finishing the project to sum up my experiences.

Thoughts after finishing the web page:

Project finished and it has been quite a ride. For sure the most flustrating part was the top section and getting it's alignment and flexibility right.

Other parts were also challanging at some points but went far smoother.

I have learned a ton of new CSS properties and values, while researching solutions for this project. Definetely a big side benefit.

This page is not the most handsome looking one, but it never was my intention. Just wanted to make it somewhat pleaseing to look at, and personalize the content proposed by the design template from The Odin Project Crew.

Might comeback later for some code clean-up. Always happy to hear some constructive feedback, so feel free to comment!

Still, I'm quite happy with the final outcome and can't wait to start the JavaScript lessons.

Stay tuned for more projects to come!
